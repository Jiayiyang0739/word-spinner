However, as for formal writing, this is the reason why I don’t write, I took Chinese literature,  English B ( English class for English leaners) of IB curriculum. And I also took writing 1009 last year here in the university. However, I still feel stressed when writing. Basically because my poor organization and lack of ideas when write for a specific topic. I always feel struggled when I have to write for a few pages Or a long essay. And one of my concern is I think writing in English is different from writing in Chinese in terms of author’s intention and writing technique.
